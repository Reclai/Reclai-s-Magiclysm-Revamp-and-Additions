# Reclai-s-Magiclysm-Revamp-and-Additions

Not my mod, I took this from Kenan's Modpack and changed it so it fits the latest experimental whenever I decide to play.

I played this before it got outdated, and liked it enough I went out of my way to maintain it so I can still play with it.

Only reason I put this to git is because apparently there's a few people who also want to play with this. Have fun.

Don't expect regular updates. If this gets updated, then that means I'm in a CDDA mood.

Feel free to fork and make changes of your own.

Last update is for CDDA Experimental 2025-06-20-0644
